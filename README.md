# Daily

## What is this?
We have a daily process at Netmedi, where a song (~3min long) starts to play at 11:15. During the song everybody has time to prepare themselves to the daily: writing post-its, contemplate existence and such...

Todo:
- [ ] Make multiple rooms for different daily songs, it's easy to troll us atm.
- [ ] Find a way to start playing a video on a inactive tab.

## Usage

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
